# **Parental Monitoring System**

## **Overview**

This project is a **Parental Monitoring System** designed to help parents monitor their children's computer activity in a safe and responsible manner. It allows for **keystroke logging**, **screenshot capture**, and **email reporting**, ensuring that parents can keep an eye on their child's online behavior.  

The system is built using **Python** with **Flask** for the backend, **React** for the frontend, and **Clerk** for authentication. It also integrates with a database to store logs and screenshots securely.

üö® **Important**: This software is intended for ethical use **only**. The user must have explicit consent before monitoring any system they do not own. Unauthorized use of this tool may violate privacy laws.

## **Features**

‚úÖ **Keystroke Logging**  
- Logs typed keystrokes to help parents understand their child's online interactions.  

‚úÖ **Screenshot Capture**  
- Takes periodic screenshots to provide a visual history of activity.  

‚úÖ **Email Reports**  
- Sends email reports at regular intervals with keystroke logs and screenshots.  

‚úÖ **Secure Authentication**  
- Uses **Clerk** for user authentication, ensuring that only authorized parents can access the logs.  

‚úÖ **Database Integration**

‚úÖ **RESTful API**  
- Allows for seamless integration with a frontend or mobile application.  

‚úÖ **Download Logs**  
- Parents can download logs and screenshots in a ZIP file for offline review.
